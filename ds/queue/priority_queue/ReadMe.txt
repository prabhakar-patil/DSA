Priority queue
    The queue shall be maintained in a perticular order. 
    Such order signifies queue priority. 
    In our example we are maintaining priority by considering data value in increasing order.
    Lower data value has higher priority. So whenever you dequeue from priority queue data structure,
    client will get node with data value least amongst all. 
    To achieve this, we made sure that the queue is sorted at the time of enqueue().
    There can be many more solution to achieve priority queue.
